# NLP Python Projects
This is a series of projects for the Winter 2021 Artificial Intelligence II course on [DIT@UoA](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en).

## Goals & Tasks
The course is focused on **Natural Language Processing**. The main areas of interest of this project series are:
- **Vaccine Sentiment Classification**
- **Question Answering** on the [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset, by fine-tuning the `BertForQuestionAnswering` pretrained model
- The thoretical background of the tools used throughout the project.

## Technologies & Tools used for development
- **scikit-learn**
- **PyTorch**
- VS Code, Google Colab & Kaggle

## Data & Dependencies
- The Classification tasks are conducted on **Tweets**, to determine whether the author is **0. Neutral**, **1. Pro-Vaccine** or **2. Anti-Vaccine**. Train & Validation sets can be found on `datasets`.

- Projects 2 & 3 use the pretrained [GloVe word embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The selected archive is `glove.6.b.zip`. To use them, download the archive and extract it in `embeddings`.

- Project 4 uses the SQuAD 2.0 [train](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v2.0.json) & [dev](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v2.0.json) sets, which can be downloaded & placed in `embeddings` as well.
